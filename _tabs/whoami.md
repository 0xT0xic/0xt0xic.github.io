## I'm Toxic, but you can call me Loxic too. Im an Cybersecurity Enthusiast, and I will be publicing my blogs about cybersecurity and CTFs here.

## I mainly focus on Web Application and Active Directory hacking. But I participate in any kind of CTFs on platforms like HTB and THM.

## I also enjoy helping people about their way to hack in (only CTFs) and answering any questions related to cybersecurity they might have. You can reach me on Discord at **<span style="color: pink;">Loxic6170</span>**â€” just send me a DM, and Iâ€™ll reply as soon as I can.
