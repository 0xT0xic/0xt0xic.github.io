## What is a Hacker

 - A hacker is someone who finds smart ways to solve problems, often using computers. Some hackers help make things safer, while others break into systems.

## Who is a Hacker?

 - A hacker is someone who uses their skills to find and fix problems in computer systems, or to break into them. I'm a Hacker, because I’m confident in my skills as a hacker. I solve CTF challenges quickly, think outside the box, and can identify vulnerabilities on my own without relying on third-party help.

## How to becoma a Hacker?

 - Just start doing things man, don't wait and ask yourself if you need any pre-knowledge, do I need a good Setup, would RGBs make me hacker - Just no dude. Just. Start. Learning. There are enough resources, where you can inform yourself and several options. You can start with a free/paid course, reading books or solving CTFs/Walkthroughs. 

## Why become a Hacker?

 - Some people hack for money, others do it for fun, and some even engage in criminal activities. There are many reasons to become a hacker, and the choice is yours. If you aspire to become a magicer of the digital world, then hacking is the path for you. However, always remember—this field is constantly evolving. Even with 40 years of experience, you can never say you've learned it all. There’s always something new to discover, and continuous learning is key to staying ahead.

## Types of Hackers

- <span style="color: white;">White Hat Hackers</span>: These are ethical hackers who help companies and organizations protect their systems and fix security issues.
- <span style="color: black;">Black Hat Hackers</span>: These hackers break the law by exploiting weaknesses in systems for personal gain or to cause harm.
- <span style="color: grey;">Grey Hat Hackers</span>: These hackers work in both legal and illegal areas. They might find security issues, but don’t always follow the rules when dealing with them.
- <span style="color: red;">Red Hat Hackers</span>: These hackers focus on stopping black hat hackers. They usually take strong or aggressive actions to protect systems.

## Hacker Mindset

- A true hacker isn’t just about breaking into systems. It’s about how you approach problems. Hackers are curious, creative, and persistent. They don’t give up when something doesn’t work – they keep trying until they find the solution. This mindset helps hackers grow and learn in any situation, not just hacking.

## Essential Skills

- **Networking:** Understand how networks work (TCP/IP, DNS, etc.).
- **Operating Systems:** Get comfortable with Linux and Windows.
- **Security:** Learn how vulnerabilities happen and how to find them.
- **Debugging & Reverse Engineering:** Be able to look at code and figure out how it works or breaks.

*<span style="color: green;">(Optional):</span>*
- Programming: Know at least one language, like for example Python

## Illegal vs. Legal Hacking

- Hacking can be either legal or illegal. Legal hacking means testing systems with permission, like penetration testing or bug bounty hunting. Illegal hacking is breaking into systems without consent – for money, revenge, or just for fun. Illegal hacking can lead to serious consequences, so always stay on the right side of the law.
